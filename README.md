# Data Structures Module

## Overview

A various collection of data structures, including **linked lists, stacks, queues, sets**, and more, for Node.js and JavaScript projects. Simplify complex data operations and promote code reusability in web servers, utilities, and data-intensive apps with seamless **CommonJS** and **ESM** integration.

## Key Data Structures

- **Linked List**: A flexible linked list implementation for dynamic data storage and manipulation.
- **Stack**: A stack data structure for managing data in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner.
- **Queue**: A queue data structure for managing data in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner.
- **Sets**: A set data structure for handling unique values and set operations.

## Benefits

- Efficient Data Management: Easily handle and organize data with optimized data structures.
- Code Reusability: Encapsulate common data operations, reducing code duplication.
- Interoperability: Import and use the toolbox seamlessly in CommonJS and ESM environments.

## Use Cases

- Use linked lists for managing data with dynamic insertions and deletions.
- Employ stacks and queues for algorithmic operations or task scheduling.
- Utilize sets for maintaining unique collections of data.

## Getting Started

1. Install npm package to your project

    `npm i my-data-structures`

2. Usage

- ESM

```javascript
    import { linkedList } from 'my-data-structures';

    const list = new LinkedList();
```

- CommonJS

```javascript
    const { linkedList } = require('my-data-structures');

    const list = new LinkedList();
```
